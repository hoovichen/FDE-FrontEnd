> This is the first article in the Fire Dragon “Flavoured Chili Sauce Series.”  
> It explains how **Green Cap Fire Dragon** was born, how we understand flavour, and why it became our internal baseline.

## 1. When You First See Three Colours, What Makes Green Cap Different?

Many first-time customers ask the same question:

> Red, Yellow, Green — what’s the difference?

Visually, Green Cap is the least dramatic.
The cap colour is familiar. The packaging is simple. Nothing flashy.

Yet internally, we’ve always regarded Green Cap as our most fundamental — and most classic — variant.

Because it wasn’t created to segment the market.

It was the result of a turning point —  
when we moved away from traditional garlic chili sauce  
and began asking:

> Why can some chili sauces be eaten continuously, while others become tiring after a few bites?

That question led to Green Cap.

## 2. The Real Problem Wasn’t Taste — It Was Longevity

In the early days, we made classic garlic chili sauce:

**Chili, garlic, oil, water, seasoning — thickened with starch slurry.**

At small scale, it worked well.

But once production scaled up, a pattern appeared:

Freshly cooked, the sauce tasted good.  
But after some time — even without spoilage — the flavour began to shift.

We later described this as:

**A short appreciation window.**

This is not about shelf life.  
Shelf life concerns sterilisation and storage.

Appreciation window refers to:

> Under proper storage,  
> how long the sauce continues to taste “good.”

After exhausting adjustments to ratio and process, we realised something:

If the sauce’s internal composition lacks stability,  
minor tweaks won’t fix it.

That was when a simple but unconventional thought emerged:

> Since we already use sweet potato starch for thickening,
> what if we used sweet potato itself?

Not to innovate.  
But because we had reached a ceiling.

## 3. When Sweet Potato Entered the Equation

The first batch wasn’t spectacular.

But three changes were clear:

- More stable viscosity  
- Improved pourability  
- A smoother eating experience  

More importantly:

People naturally dipped again.

It didn’t become louder.
It became more coherent.

The sweetness, once dependent on added sugar,  
was now supported by sweet potato’s natural sweetness.

The texture stabilised.

And most crucially:

> The flavour no longer “collapsed” as quickly over time.

It wasn’t protected.

It became more resilient.

More eatable.

That was when we first felt:

This version might be capable of becoming a baseline.

We called it:

**The Sweet Potato Version.**

And this marked the beginning of Fire Dragon’s flavour route —  
and eventually, the Green Cap route.

## 4. Understanding “Eatable” Through Flavour Layers

Once the Sweet Potato Version stabilised,  
we asked:

> Why does it feel more eatable?

We use “flavour” not as a judgement,  
but as a way to break down perception.

We see flavour in three layers:

### First Layer: Immediate Taste

Spiciness. Sweetness. Garlic intensity.

### Second Layer: Development

How spice unfolds.
How garlic appears.

### Third Layer: Afterfeel & Texture

How the sauce coats food.  
Whether flavours separate.  
Whether heaviness lingers.

The Sweet Potato Version performed particularly well in this third layer.

We believe this was one key factor in extending its appreciation window.

Because when something is deeply eatable,  
even slight changes over time remain acceptable.

(Yes — that’s partly a joke.)

## 5. Why Sweet Potato Worked

Sweet potato offers:

- Natural starch and fibre  
- Gentle, non-dominant sweetness  

At the right ratio, it doesn’t sweeten the sauce overtly.

It softens the entry.

In today’s Green Cap:

- Spice rises gradually  
- Sweetness appears first  
- Garlic follows  
- Spice builds last  

Sweet potato moderates intensity.

And that makes Green Cap:

Not dramatic — but sustainable.

It’s still a chili sauce.

Not a health product.

Just one with a slightly broader nutritional base from real ingredients.

---

## 6. Why We Kept the Sweet Potato Route

To clarify:

The “Sweet Potato Version” was not the final Green Cap.

It was the prototype.

After solving the appreciation window issue,  
we explored many other fruit and vegetable combinations.

Some were bold.
Some were intense.
Some were strange.
(Some experiments should not be repeated. Durian, for example.)

But we learned:

> Not every exciting flavour is sustainable.

Some sauces impress instantly.
But become tiring quickly.

So we asked:

> If only one sauce could remain as the most versatile — what would it look like?

Not the loudest.
Not the strongest.

But the one that doesn’t fight the food.

The Sweet Potato Version became the base.
And from that base, Green Cap was refined.

It isn’t compromise.

It’s our classic.

## 7. Who Is Green Cap For?

Green Cap may suit you if:

- You enjoy spice, but not extreme heat  
- You want versatility  
- You’re unsure of your preference  
- You prefer sauce to support, not dominate  
- You value smoothness over intensity  

You don’t need to analyse flavour.

If you find yourself dipping again naturally —  
that’s enough.

## Conclusion: Classic Is Not Loud

Green Cap exists not because it shouts.

But because after many experiments —  
it remained stable.

It represents the first real departure from traditional garlic chili sauce.

If you want to understand Fire Dragon from its foundation —  
start here.

Green Cap.
