## Why We Started Fire Dragon

People often ask us,  
why a family-made sauce  
needs a website, a brand, and stories.

The answer is simple.

Some flavors disappear  
if no one takes the time to preserve them.

We want to keep  
**the flavors that might otherwise be forgotten**.

## It Started in the Kitchen

At the beginning,  
these sauces were only for our family.

A jar of chili, a pot of garlic paste—  
just part of everyday cooking.

Then neighbors, friends, and regular customers started asking:

> “Where can I buy this?”

That was when we realized  
these flavors deserved to go further.

## Great Flavors Often Come from Small Places

We’ve always believed that  
**some of the best food comes from small towns.**

Sometimes you taste something unforgettable in a quiet place,  
only to find it impossible to get again once you’re home.

Not because it’s bad,  
but because it was never properly shared or documented.

Before e-commerce became common,  
many local products stayed where they were.

## Times Have Changed

Fire Dragon Enterprise was founded in 2010.  
Back then, online selling existed—but not like today.

Now, with the right tools and stories,  
local flavors have a chance to travel.

Pantai Remis chili sauce is a good example.  
It started small,  
yet found its way to tables across Malaysia.

Some people love it,  
some are not used to it.

But the flavor lives on.

## More Than Just Selling Sauce

What we’re doing now may still be small—  
mostly flavors from around our home.

But our idea is simple:

- Preserve real, local flavors  
- Share the stories behind them  
- Let more people discover different tastes  

We hope that one day,  
we’ll meet more people who care about food the same way,  
and slowly bring more local specialties to more places.

We’re not rushing to grow fast.  
We just want to do this honestly.

If you enjoy these flavors and stories,  
we invite you to follow along.

The next sauce you fall in love with
