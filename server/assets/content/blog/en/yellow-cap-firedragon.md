## Background | When “A Little Spicier” Was No Longer Simple

After the Green Cap Fire Dragon Chilli Sauce became stable, we began receiving a clear type of feedback:

> **“Can it be spicier?”**

This request was neither complicated nor niche.  
In certain regions and food cultures, chilli sauce is expected to carry stronger presence — not merely as a supporting flavour, but as a central element during eating.

At first glance, the solution seemed obvious:

**Increase the chilli ratio in the Green Cap formula.**

But once we entered actual testing, we quickly realised it was not that straightforward.

---

### Why We Couldn’t Simply “Add More Chilli”

The Green Cap flavour profile was built around *eatability*.

Sweet potato played two important roles:

1. **Texture function**  
   Providing stable and even viscosity, ensuring consistency in coating, mixing and mouthfeel.

2. **Taste function**  
   Offering a natural sweetness that softened the sharpness of chilli and garlic at first contact.

When we attempted to increase chilli and garlic directly within this profile, several issues surfaced:

- **Sweet potato’s balancing role weakened**  
  While it still maintained texture, the harmony between sweetness and heat was disrupted, resulting in a rougher overall taste.

- **Heat became one-dimensional**  
  The spice level increased, but the experience shifted toward blunt intensity rather than layered progression.  
  From entry to swallow, the sensation was dominated almost entirely by heat.

- **Garlic presence was compressed**  
  With higher chilli concentration, garlic struggled to hold its space in the flavour progression.

We also observed something significant during repeated tastings:

> **At its existing ratio, sweet potato appeared to slow down the release of heat in the mouth.**

In Green Cap, this slower release was beneficial.

However, once heat was increased significantly, sweet potato could no longer sustain this controlled release. The spice began to concentrate rather than layer.

Increasing sweet potato further would compromise texture — viscosity rose, flow reduced, and pouring became difficult.

At that point, we concluded:

Sweet potato was not suitable as the core supporting ingredient for a high-heat direction.

---

### The Design Objective Became Clear

It was during this stage that we recognised a crucial fact:

> If the goal is “higher heat,” we cannot simply adjust the Green Cap ratio.

What we needed was not a “spicier Green Cap,”  
but a **new flavour direction**, redesigned from the centre of gravity outward.

This new direction had to meet three conditions:

- Heat must be clearly perceived, with distinct stages of release  
- Garlic must hold strong presence, not fade into background  
- Sweetness must come from natural ingredients, reflecting traditional flavour expectations — not industrial sugar tones

The Yellow Cap Fire Dragon Chilli Sauce began from this point.

It was not an extension of Green Cap.  
It was a reconstruction.

## Design Phase | Rebuilding the Flavour Direction

### 1. Starting From the High-Heat Objective

This time, we were not aiming for “slightly spicier.”

We were designing around:

**Higher heat, stronger garlic, and traditional sweetness.**

The question became:

> If sweet potato cannot support high heat, what ingredient can?

After multiple rounds of testing, we turned to pumpkin.

---

### 2. Why Pumpkin?

Pumpkin was not chosen for its distinct flavour.

It was selected for its structural properties:

- Higher dietary fibre content  
- Natural sweetness with clearer definition  
- Softens when cooked but retains fibrous texture  

During testing, we observed:

> When chilli and pumpkin fibres were fully integrated,  
> the way heat released in the mouth changed.

Unlike sweet potato, pumpkin did not noticeably slow down the overall heat progression.

Instead, at appropriate ratios, it allowed heat to release in clearer stages.

We hypothesise that pumpkin’s fibrous matrix affects how capsaicin adheres and disperses during chewing and swallowing, creating layered perception.

This is not a laboratory claim — it is a sensory observation formed through repeated testing.

But it was exactly what we needed.

### 3. Yellow Cap’s Flavour Progression

Using our three-layer flavour model:

**Yellow Cap Fire Dragon Chilli Sauce** follows a different rhythm from Green Cap.

#### First Layer: Entry

A gentle but identifiable natural sweetness appears first.  
Not dominant, but recognisable — a traditional sweet base.

#### Second Layer: Garlic Lead

Immediately after, strong garlic takes centre stage.

Garlic holds the flavour focus before heat fully unfolds, creating a defined transition.

#### Third Layer: Heat Release & Aftertaste

Heat then releases fully before and after swallowing.

This heat comes from chilli itself —  
not from artificial capsaicin extract that lingers sharply and aggressively.

It lasts longer than Green Cap,  
but does not extend endlessly.

After swallowing, warmth remains in the mouth and throat for a while before gradually subsiding.

We believe pumpkin’s fibre influences how capsaicin disperses and attaches, allowing a more linear and extended release.

This extended yet controlled aftertaste is precisely what many high-heat enthusiasts seek.

---

### 4. An Unexpected Discovery: Colour

Another unexpected finding emerged.

Pumpkin brightened the sauce’s colour.

Compared to the deeper tones of the sweet potato route, Yellow Cap presents a warmer, fuller hue.

We gradually realised:

> Supporting ingredients affect not only flavour perception —  
> but also visual identity.

This observation continues to inform our later explorations.

---

### 5. Market Response & Design Outcome

To be honest, Yellow Cap did not become our best-selling variant.

Its flavour is more defined and more assertive.  
That makes it easier to love — and easier to reject.

But from a design standpoint, it achieved something important:

> Under a high-heat objective,  
> flavour layers can still remain coordinated.

If Green Cap represents **eatability as baseline**,  
Yellow Cap represents:

> The possibility of maintaining layered progression even within high heat.

This was not an extension.

It was a verification.

And the answer was — yes.

---

## Conclusion | When “Spicy” Becomes Expression

Yellow Cap was never meant to replace Green Cap.

It exists because we had to answer another question:

> At higher heat levels,  
> can clarity and coordination still be preserved?

Yellow Cap is our answer.

It is more direct than Green Cap.

But it follows the same principle:

Heat should not be blunt intensity —  
it should be something perceivable, distinguishable, and memorable.

If you prefer chilli sauce with presence,  
garlic that lingers,  
and sweetness from ingredients rather than industrial sugar —

Yellow Cap may be for you.

It may not be the most popular.

But it is clear.

And that clarity is its purpose.
