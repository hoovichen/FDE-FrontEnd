summary: After defining both the high-heat and balanced-eating routes, we faced a seemingly contradictory request — a chili sauce that is almost not spicy, yet still preserves the layered character of a traditional chili sauce.

## Background | When People Who “Don’t Really Eat Spicy” Still Want Chili Sauce

After launching Green Cap and Yellow Cap, we began receiving interesting feedback:

> “Do you have something mildly spicy?”  
> “I don’t really eat spicy food, but I want a bit of chili sauce flavor.”  
> “Can dip, but don’t want to feel heaty.”

This demand has always existed.

Some people simply cannot tolerate spice.  
Some avoid high heat for health reasons.  
Others just want chili sauce on the table — without it becoming overwhelming.

At first glance, this sounds easier than making something spicier.

Just reduce the chili, right?

But when we actually tested it, we discovered:

> **Designing something not spicy is harder than designing something spicy.**

## Why Is a “Not Spicy” Chili Sauce So Difficult?

With Green Cap and Yellow Cap,  
we were working on balancing heat.

This time, we faced a different question:

> How do we let heat appear — but not linger?

From previous experimentation, we already understood the relationship between supporting ingredients and chili heat.

Sweet potato, pumpkin, papaya —  
all contain structured fiber.

We noticed something very clearly:

> Capsaicin from chili easily attaches to fiber structures.

In high-heat designs, this is actually beneficial —  
it prolongs the heat and strengthens the aftertaste.

But in a low-heat goal, it becomes an obstacle.

As long as high-fiber ingredients are used,  
heat will linger in the mouth.

Even if the overall spiciness is low,  
the aftertaste remains long.

This directly contradicts our goal:  
heat that appears briefly, then exits quickly.

---

## Another Reality: The Side Effects of Ingredients

During testing, we observed something else.

Different ingredients don’t just change how heat is released —  
they also significantly affect color and visual texture.

Some ingredients create deeper, heavier tones.  
Some reduce clarity and brightness.

For a “light-heat” direction,  
this visual heaviness felt mismatched.

We realized:

If we wanted to design an almost-not-spicy chili sauce,  
we could not simply reduce chili levels,  
nor could we reuse fiber-heavy logic.

---

## When the Design Goal Became Clear

At this point, we redefined the goal:

- Heat must exist, but only briefly  
- It should not linger long in the mouth  
- Traditional sweetness and garlic layers must remain  
- Visually, it should feel light and clear  

It sounded almost contradictory.

But precisely because it was difficult —  
it was worth designing.

The Red Cap route began here.

# Design Phase | When “Cooling” Became Inspiration

## 1. Rethinking the Core Ingredient

If our goal was clear —  
not “less spicy,”  
but “heat that exits quickly” —

Then we could no longer rely on fiber-heavy attachment that traps capsaicin in the mouth.

We needed something lighter in texture, looser in structure,  
and less likely to hold onto heat.

After multiple rounds of testing and discussion,  
we turned to a humble ingredient often overlooked:

**Winter melon.**

## 2. Why Winter Melon?

In everyday Malaysian cooking, winter melon is often used in soups.

Traditionally, it is associated with “cooling” properties.

But what interested us wasn’t tradition —  
it was physics.

Compared to sweet potato or pumpkin, winter melon:

- Contains very low starch  
- Has looser fiber structure  
- Holds high natural water content  

This means:

It does not form thick, dense texture like starchy gourds.  
It does not trap heat like fiber-heavy ingredients.

In our first winter melon batch, two changes were obvious:

- **Clearer appearance**  
  The natural juices created a lighter, slightly reflective surface.

- **Smoother flow**  
  Less dense, less sticky, easier to pour.

But the most important difference was in taste.

## 3. Flavor Behavior: Heat Appears — But Does Not Stay

Using our three-layer model:

### First Layer: Entry

Sweetness appears first.

This is natural.  
The front of the tongue detects sweetness most easily.

When heat is not overwhelming, sweetness can be perceived clearly.

In winter melon version,  
sweetness feels light, not heavy.

---

### Second Layer: Gentle Garlic

Next comes garlic.

Unlike Yellow Cap’s bold garlic,  
this version is softer.

It coexists briefly with sweetness,  
instead of being immediately overtaken by heat.

---

### Third Layer: Gentle Heat

Then heat appears.

It is not explosive.  
It does not expand aggressively.

You can clearly feel it —  
but it is mild.

Most importantly:

**It does not linger.**

After swallowing,  
heat fades relatively quickly.

We believe winter melon’s higher water content and looser structure  
reduce capsaicin attachment and retention.

Unlike pumpkin or sweet potato routes,  
heat is not “held.”

Interestingly,  
after heat fades, sweetness and garlic reappear.

In Yellow Cap,  
heat dominates once released.

In Red Cap,  
heat is not the ending.

## Final Thoughts | When Heat Is No Longer the Star

Red Cap is perhaps the most misunderstood route.

Spice lovers may find it too mild.

But we believe chili sauce does not have to be defined only by heat.

If Green Cap represents balanced eating,  
and Yellow Cap represents bold heat —

Red Cap represents another possibility:

> When heat steps back,  
> can chili sauce still stand?

Our answer is yes.

## Who Is Red Cap For?

- Those who don’t usually eat spicy food  
- Those who want chili flavor without long heat  
- Families with mixed spice tolerance  
- Anyone who wants layered flavor without strong stimulation  

Red Cap is not about intensity.

It is about accessibility.

It may not impress immediately.

But it may feel reassuring.

And sometimes —  
that is exactly what is needed.
