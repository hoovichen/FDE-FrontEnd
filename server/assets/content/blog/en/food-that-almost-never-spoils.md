## Yes — and the answer is surprisingly simple

If you are really looking for **foods that can last for decades and still be edible**,  
the answer isn’t mysterious at all.

There are only three:

- **Salt**
- **Oil**
- **Vinegar**

Salt remains salt even after a hundred years.  
Vinegar is still vinegar after decades.  
Oil, as long as it hasn’t clearly oxidized or gone rancid, is still oil.

This is not folklore —  
it is one of the most reliable facts in food preservation.

## Why do they almost never spoil?

Because they are **hostile environments for microorganisms**.

- **Salt**  
  Contains almost no usable water,  
  causing bacteria and mold to dehydrate and die.

- **Vinegar**  
  Creates an acidic environment  
  where most bacteria cannot survive.

- **Oil**  
  Does not mix with water,  
  effectively blocking air and moisture.

In simple terms:

> **They place food in an environment where microbes cannot live.**

## Most everyday foods follow the same principle

Foods that “seem to last a long time”  
are rarely preserved by accident.

They simply apply the same logic  
in different forms.

- Salted fish, pickled vegetables → **Salt**
- Pickles, vinegar-preserved foods → **Acidity**
- Chili oil, oil-preserved garlic → **Oil as a barrier**
- Dried meat, smoked foods → **Dehydration**
- Vacuum packaging → **Removing oxygen**

Even modern food processing  
has not changed the core idea.

It has only made these methods  
more stable and controlled.

## Then why do products still have an expiration date?

Because expiration dates come with **conditions**:

> **Unopened, sealed, and stored under standard conditions.**

Once a package is opened:

- The vacuum is broken  
- Air enters  
- Moisture enters  
- Environmental microbes gain access  

**The real countdown starts at that moment.**

## Milk is the easiest example

Unopened milk already has a relatively short shelf life.

Once opened:

- At room temperature, it can spoil within **one day**
- It is usually recommended to finish within **2–3 days**
- Even in the refrigerator,  
  consumption after **7 days is not advised**

Milk does not suddenly “turn bad.”  
It simply enters an environment  
**where microbes grow extremely well**.

## How does the food industry extend shelf life?

Most packaged foods use at least one of these methods:

- Vacuum sealing  
- Nitrogen flushing  
- Hot or cold filling  
- Airtight containers  

All of them aim to do the same thing:

> **Limit exposure to air, moisture, and bacteria.**

But it is important to remember:

**Sealed does not mean sterile forever.**

It slows change —  
it does not stop time.

## How should we store food at home?

The principle is simple:

> **The better you isolate food from its environment, the safer it is.**

From most to least stable:

1. **Freezing**  
   Microbial activity is nearly halted.  
   Best for long-term storage.

2. **Refrigeration**  
   Slows microbial growth.  
   Suitable for short-term use.

3. **Room temperature, dry, sealed**  
   Depends on the type of food.

4. **Room temperature, humid, frequently opened**  
   Highest risk.

A refrigerator is not a safe vault.  
Frequent opening and temperature fluctuations  
introduce new bacteria.

For sauces especially,  
**clean utensils and tightly closing the lid**  
matter more than most people realize.

## A realistic and safe guideline for sauces

For oil-based sauces  
(such as sambal, dried shrimp chili, ginger-garlic paste):

- **Unopened**: follow the printed expiration date  
- **After opening**:
  - Store refrigerated  
  - Use clean utensils  
  - **Consume within 1–3 months for best safety**

Longer storage may be possible in theory,  
but risk increases over time.

If you notice:

- Visible mold  
- Unusual odor  
- Clear signs of spoilage  

**Discard it immediately.**

No food is worth risking your health.

## One sentence worth remembering

Food preservation  
is not about “how long something can last.”

It is about:

> **Whether you are creating a place where microbes can survive.**

Understanding this makes food storage  
both safer and less stressful.
